# 🏆 TypeScript Debugging Escape Room

## 📜 Overview
Welcome to the **TypeScript Debugging Escape Room!** You and your team are **trapped in a bug-infested fortress**, and the only way to escape is by fixing all the broken TypeScript code.

## 🎯 Objective
Fix the **5 stages of buggy TypeScript code** to unlock the exit and **win the game!** Each stage presents a different coding challenge that aligns with key TypeScript concepts.

## ⏳ Time Limit
- You have **20-30 minutes** to complete all challenges.
- Work **individually or in pairs**.

## 🏆 How to Win
The **first team** to correctly fix all 5 bugs and run their code successfully **escapes the fortress!**

## 🏰 **Game Theme: The Fortress of Type Errors**

You have entered the **Fortress of Type Errors**, an ancient place filled with **corrupted TypeScript code**. The only way to **escape** is by solving each coding puzzle that the fortress throws at you.

### **Your Journey:**
1. 🚪 **Stage 1: The Locked Gate** – Solve a **Type Mismatch issue** to open the gate.
2. 🛠️ **Stage 2: The Missing Blueprint** – Fix **missing types and interfaces** to restore the plans.
3. 📦 **Stage 3: The Cursed Inventory** – Overcome **array and object manipulation errors** to retrieve supplies.
4. 🔄 **Stage 4: The Temporal Rift** – Resolve **asynchronous code issues** to stabilize time.
5. 🏆 **Final Boss: The Type Guardian’s Riddle** – Defeat the guardian by fixing **class and inheritance problems**.

## 🚀 **Rules & Instructions**
- You will receive **five TypeScript files**, each containing a bug.
- Your goal is to **identify and fix** the errors in each file.
- No external references are allowed—work with your team’s knowledge!
- Once you fix a stage, test your code to ensure it runs correctly.
- Raise your hand (or submit proof) when you've successfully completed all five challenges.
- **The first team to finish escapes and wins!**

## 🔥 **Bonus: Chaos Mode (Extra Challenges!)**
For teams moving too fast, throw in an additional **Chaos Mode challenge** for each stage:

### **🚪 Stage 1: The Locked Gate - CHAOS MODE** 🔥
- 🔀 **Extra Challenge:** The gate code must now be dynamically generated and validated **without hardcoding values**.
- 💡 **Hint:** Use a **random number generator** and ensure the code is checked dynamically.

### **🛠️ Stage 2: The Missing Blueprint - CHAOS MODE** 🔥
- 📜 **Extra Challenge:** The blueprint must support **multiple variations** (e.g., different materials), requiring **a union type or a generic interface**.
- 💡 **Hint:** Use **TypeScript generics or unions** to allow flexibility in the blueprint types.

### **📦 Stage 3: The Cursed Inventory - CHAOS MODE** 🔥
- 🏷️ **Extra Challenge:** The inventory should allow adding new items, but items should have **unique IDs** and be **stored in an object instead of an array**.
- 💡 **Hint:** Use **a dictionary-like object (`Record<string, T>`) and assign unique IDs** to items.

### **🔄 Stage 4: The Temporal Rift - CHAOS MODE** 🔥
- ⏳ **Extra Challenge:** The rift must now **execute a callback function** after a delay **without using setTimeout**.
- 💡 **Hint:** Use a **manual delay mechanism** like a while-loop that tracks elapsed time.

### **🏆 Stage 5: The Type Guardian’s Riddle - CHAOS MODE** 🔥
- 🏰 **Extra Challenge:** The Guardian must now support **multiple types of guardians** (Fire, Ice, Thunder), requiring **a subclass for each and a factory function to create them dynamically**.
- 💡 **Hint:** Use **a factory function to instantiate different subclass variations dynamically**.
